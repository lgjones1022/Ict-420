                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Lane Jones, and I am a senior at the University of Kentucky. I'm currently employed by Apple as a specialist.
                    I am excited for the future as I have taken a post grad position at Axle Logistics in Knoxville, TN and can't wait to take the next step in my life.

                    <h3>My Life Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        My life goals are to own my own company one day and be able to travel the world. I like challenges and believe that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
                        I am a very determined person and will not stop until I reach my goals.
