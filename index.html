                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a 22-year-old college student from Lexington, Kentucky, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree with a focus in Business & Organizational Communication. In addition to my major, I am also earning a certificate in Innovation and Entrepreneurial Thinking. My academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in both communication theory and practical business strategies, enabling me to effectively bridge the gap between organizational needs and innovative solutions.
                    As a communicator, I have a deep understanding of the role language plays in shaping group identities and facilitating meaningful dialogue. I’m especially interested in how communication can drive organizational change and foster inclusive environments. My coursework and research have allowed me to explore both local and national political dynamics, helping me develop a nuanced perspective on the intersection of politics and communication.  
                    I am passionate about using my skills to help organizations improve their internal and external communication, enhance team collaboration, and develop strategies that drive growth and innovation. Whether through thoughtful public health messaging or navigating complex business environments, I am always looking for new ways to apply my communication expertise in impactful, creative ways.

                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have a deep love for the outdoors and adventure. I’m an avid camper and enjoy spending time in nature, whether it’s hiking, exploring new trails, or simply hammocking in a peaceful spot. Being outdoors is a way for me to recharge and gain perspective, and I cherish the opportunity to disconnect from the fast-paced world around me.
                    In addition to my love for nature, I have a creative side that comes alive with Legos. Building intricate structures allows me to engage in problem-solving while enjoying a relaxing, hands-on activity. This creativity also extends to my passion for F1 racing, where I follow the latest races, teams, and innovations in the sport. 
                    I am also a big fan of college sports and love attending games, supporting my teams, and celebrating the the wins. Whether it’s football, basketball, baseball or other college sports, the thrill of live games and the passion of fellow fans is something I truly enjoy.
                    Traveling is another key passion of mine. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and learning from diverse perspectives enriches my life and broadens my worldview. Each trip is an opportunity to discover something new, whether it’s a new city or a hidden gem off the beaten path.

            At the moment, I am so excited to graduate from the University of Kentucky with a degree in Communications.
            More specifically, a pathway in business with two certificates: one in entrepreneurship and the other in sports and mass media.

        <p>
            That will be happening on <strong>May 9th, 2025, at Rupp Arena.</strong><br>
            I am looking forward to the next chapter of my life and what it will bring as I have accepted a full-time position with Axle Logistics as a Logistics Coordinator.
            The next steps in my life will be moving down to Knoxville, Tennessee. Living alone for the first time will be a big change, but I am so excited to take on this new adventure.
